# parallelcluster-closednetwork
set up AWS ParallelCluster on closed network environment


## Usage

### 1. Set up VPC and Private Gateways

#### 1a: Set up closed network environment with CloudFormation

Launch CloudFormation template below. It includes VPC, private subnet, required Private Gateways for various services. 
If you set `UseSSM` to `true`, template also set up PrivateLinks for Systems Manager Session Manager to test the cluster.

**Info: In some AZ, they have missing PrivateLink service and failed to set up CloudFormation template. At that case, you could chose different AZ by setting AZ letter on `SubnetAZLetter` (a/b/c/d etc..)**

[![Launch](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudformation-examples/cloudformation-launch-stack.png)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?#/stacks/new?stackName=ClosedEnvironment&templateURL=https://midaisuk-public-templates.s3.amazonaws.com/parallelcluster-closednetwork/closed-vpc-privatelink.yml
)

or with CLI

```bash
$ aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name ClosedEnvironment --template-url https://midaisuk-public-templates.s3.amazonaws.com/parallelcluster-closednetwork/closed-vpc-privatelink.yml
```

#### 1b: Set up closed network environment manually 

*this step is not required if you use CloudFormation template*

You need to set up following components.

- VPC
- Private Subnet for the VPC
- Security Group for PrivateLinks
- Private Gateway
  - s3
  - dynamodb
  - logs
  - cloudformation
  - monitoring
  - ec2
  - sqs
  - sns
  - autoscaling

If you want to use Systems Manager Session Manager for testing the cluster, you also need to set up following PrivateLinks.

- ssmmessages
- ec2messages
- ssm


### 2. Launch AWS ParallelCluster

Launch ParallelCluster with config file for closed network condition.

- closed-network.config

```
[aws]
aws_region_name = <REGION>

[global]
update_check = true
sanity_check = true
cluster_template = closed

[aliases]
ssh = ssh {CFN_USER}@{MASTER_IP} {ARGS}

[cluster closed]
key_name = <KEY_NAME>
additional_iam_policies = arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore
base_os = alinux2
scheduler = slurm
master_instance_type = c5.large
compute_instance_type = c5.xlarge
disable_hyperthreading = true
initial_queue_size = 0
max_queue_size = 10
vpc_settings = closed

[vpc closed]
vpc_id = <VPC_ID>
master_subnet_id = <SUBNET_ID>
use_public_ips = false
```

You should change `<REGION>`, `<KEY_NAME>`, `VPC_ID`, `SUBNET_ID`.
You could find `VPC_ID`, `SUBNET_ID` in the output of the cloudformation.

`AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore` is required for connecting Master node by using Session Manager.

```
$ pcluster create -c closed-network.config closed-cluster
```

### 3. Connect the cluster by Session Manager

Go to Systems Manager page on Management Console, and select Session Manager.
Select `Start Session` and chose Master instance and start session.

After connecting the Master instance, you need to change user to submit jobs.
Example input is shown in below.

```
$ sudo su ec2-user
$ cd
$ cat > job.sh
#!/bin/bash
hostname
$ sbatch job.sh
```

## Cost

You need to have extra cost for PrivateLink.

## Notification

- currently, Amazon Linux and Amazon Linux 2 could be used for closed network condition.
- On closed network condition, scale-out process needs few more minutes because of wating connection timeout of external repositories.
